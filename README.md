This App displays a list of Towers on the Homepage. Whe a tower is clicked, a list of available floors are displayed per tower clicked. Then when a particular floor is clicked, a list of Apartment Layout is displayed thereby giving the user the option to select a particular Apartment to view the Details of the Apartment.

The Lbraries used are as follows:

1. ShadCN UI for as the UI library
2. Tailwind CSS for styling
3. Framer Motion for animation
4. Country-state-city library for displaying the lists of countries
5. React Hook Form for forms

I also used the following tech stacks:
1. React.js
2. Next.js
3. Tailwind CSS

Since it's just a test app, There are no limitations.

I have also included the Login form and the Sign up forms to make the app more real and interactive
